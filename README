# status

one game for now, but it seems to work just fine!  more to come.


# intro

this will be a collection of simple games.  for now it is a collection
with one game:  blobslay.  this game with hard to pronounce name was
written after seeing bubblebreak(er?) on a windows mobile phone
(but before finding out it was a classic).


# install

first make sure you have "util" installed.

change mkconfig if you do not have $ROOT set.  "mk" and "mk install"
to compile and install.

when building from within inferno, insert SYSHOST=Inferno and ROOT=
in the mk invocations to override the values in the mkconfig.
