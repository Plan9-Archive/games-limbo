# status

one game for now, but it seems to work just fine!  more to come.


# intro

this will be a collection of simple games.  for now it is a collection
of one game:  blobslay.  this game with hard to pronounce name was
written after seeing bubblebreak(er?) on a windows mobile phone
(but before finding out it was a classic).


# install

the usual.  make sure there is a mkconfig in this directory
(symblink/bind to inferno install's mkconfig will do), and "mk
install".
