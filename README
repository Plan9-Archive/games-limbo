# status

two games already!


# intro

this will be a collection of simple games.  currently blobslay and stones.
blobslay was written after seeing bubblebreak(er?) on a windows mobile phone
(but before finding out it was a classic).  stones is similar to
the classic bejeweled.


# install

first make sure you have "util" installed, see http://www.ueber.net/code/r/util.

make sure $ROOT is set.  run "mk" to compile and "mk install" to
install.

when building from within inferno, insert SYSHOST=Inferno and ROOT=
in the mk invocations to override the values in the mkconfig.
